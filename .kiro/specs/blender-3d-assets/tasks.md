# Simplified Implementation Plan (Using Blender MCP)

## Phase 1: Generate Core Temple Assets

- [x] 1. Generate temple pathway segments using Hyper3D
  - Use text prompts: "ancient stone pathway segment", "curved temple path", "temple intersection"
  - Export as GLB to `/public/assets/models/pathways/`

- [x] 2. Generate temple architecture using Hyper3D
  - Use text prompts: "ornate stone pillar", "temple wall segment", "stone bridge platform"
  - Export as GLB to `/public/assets/models/architecture/`

- [x] 3. Generate obstacle variations using Hyper3D
  - Use text prompts: "fallen temple log", "weathered stone block", "ancient spike trap"
  - Export as GLB to `/public/assets/models/obstacles/`

- [x] 4. Generate environmental decorations using Hyper3D
  - Use text prompts: "temple tree with vines", "moss covered stone", "ancient carved symbol"
  - Export as GLB to `/public/assets/models/decorations/`

## Phase 2: Download Temple Textures from PolyHaven

- [x] 5. Download stone textures from PolyHaven
  - Search for: "stone", "marble", "brick" categories
  - Download 1k-2k resolution to `/public/assets/textures/stone/`

- [x] 6. Download metal textures from PolyHaven
  - Search for: "metal", "gold", "bronze" categories
  - Download 1k resolution to `/public/assets/textures/metal/`

- [x] 7. Download organic textures from PolyHaven
  - Search for: "wood", "moss", "dirt" categories
  - Download 1k resolution to `/public/assets/textures/organic/`

## Phase 3: Update Game Integration

- [ ] 8. Update assetManager.js for GLB loading
  - Replace procedural geometry with GLB model loading
  - Implement asset preloading from `/public/assets/models/`
  - Add texture loading from `/public/assets/textures/`

- [ ] 9. Integrate new assets into game systems
  - Update worldManager.js to use new temple models
  - Update obstacleManager.js to use new obstacle models
  - Ensure proper collision detection with new geometry

- [ ] 10. Performance optimization
  - Implement basic LOD system for distance-based quality
  - Add asset compression and optimization validation
  - Test loading performance and optimize as needed
