# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating professional-quality 3D assets using Blender to enhance the visual quality of the Temple Run-style game. The assets will include ancient temple environments, stone pathways, ornate architectural elements, and atmospheric details that match the aesthetic shown in the reference images. The generated assets will be integrated into the existing game engine to replace or enhance current visual elements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to generate high-quality 3D temple environment assets using Blender, so that the game has a professional visual appearance matching the Temple Run aesthetic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Blender asset generation system is invoked THEN it SHALL create temple environment models including pathways, pillars, walls, and architectural details
2. WHEN assets are generated THEN they SHALL match the ancient temple aesthetic with weathered stone textures and ornate carvings
3. WHEN models are created THEN they SHALL be optimized for real-time rendering with appropriate polygon counts
4. WHEN textures are applied THEN they SHALL include diffuse, normal, and roughness maps for realistic material appearance
5. IF multiple environment variations are needed THEN the system SHALL generate different temple layouts and architectural styles

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to automatically integrate Blender-generated assets into the game engine, so that new 3D models can be seamlessly used without manual conversion processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN 3D assets are generated in Blender THEN they SHALL be exported in formats compatible with the web-based game engine (GLTF/GLB)
2. WHEN assets are exported THEN they SHALL maintain proper scale and orientation for the game world
3. WHEN models are integrated THEN they SHALL replace existing placeholder geometry in the game scenes
4. WHEN textures are exported THEN they SHALL be optimized for web delivery with appropriate compression
5. IF assets have animations THEN they SHALL be exported with proper keyframe data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the generated assets to include modular components, so that I can create varied level layouts using reusable pieces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modular assets are created THEN they SHALL include straight pathway segments, curved sections, and intersection pieces
2. WHEN architectural elements are generated THEN they SHALL include standalone pillars, wall sections, and decorative elements
3. WHEN components are designed THEN they SHALL have standardized connection points for seamless assembly
4. WHEN variations are created THEN they SHALL maintain consistent visual style while providing layout diversity
5. IF special elements are needed THEN the system SHALL generate unique pieces like bridges, stairs, and platform sections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the asset generation process to include proper material setup, so that the 3D models have realistic lighting and surface properties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN materials are created THEN they SHALL use physically-based rendering (PBR) workflows
2. WHEN stone textures are applied THEN they SHALL include appropriate roughness and metallic values for realistic appearance
3. WHEN lighting is considered THEN materials SHALL respond correctly to dynamic lighting in the game engine
4. WHEN weathering effects are added THEN they SHALL include moss, dirt, and age details on stone surfaces
5. IF multiple material variations are needed THEN the system SHALL create different weathering states and stone types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the generated assets to be performance-optimized, so that the game maintains smooth framerates on target devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are created THEN they SHALL use appropriate level-of-detail (LOD) techniques
2. WHEN polygon counts are determined THEN they SHALL be optimized for real-time rendering without sacrificing visual quality
3. WHEN textures are generated THEN they SHALL use efficient resolutions and compression formats
4. WHEN assets are exported THEN they SHALL include optimized geometry with proper UV mapping
5. IF performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide options to reduce detail while maintaining visual fidelity

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to integrate atmospheric elements and environmental details, so that the temple environments feel immersive and authentic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environmental assets are created THEN they SHALL include atmospheric elements like fog, dust particles, and ambient lighting
2. WHEN decorative details are added THEN they SHALL include carved symbols, worn inscriptions, and architectural ornaments
3. WHEN vegetation is included THEN it SHALL feature moss, vines, and overgrown elements appropriate for ancient ruins
4. WHEN lighting elements are designed THEN they SHALL include torch holders, mystical glows, and shadow-casting geometry
5. IF interactive elements are needed THEN the system SHALL create assets for collectibles, obstacles, and special effects
