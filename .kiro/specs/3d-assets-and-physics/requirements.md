# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on upgrading the AI Temple Run game by implementing a Blender-based 3D asset pipeline and integrating a proper physics engine (Ammo.js or Cannon.js). The implementation will replace current placeholder geometry with professionally created 3D assets using Blender MCP tools, establish a GLB export pipeline, and replace simple collision detection with realistic physics simulation. This addresses the two most critical technical foundations needed for a commercial-quality game.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create 3D assets using Blender MCP integration, so that I can generate professional character and obstacle models directly within the development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating character assets THEN the system SHALL use Blender MCP to generate a rigged humanoid character model
2. WHEN generating obstacles THEN the system SHALL create varied 3D obstacle models using Blender MCP tools
3. WHEN exporting assets THEN the system SHALL output models in GLB format for Three.js compatibility
4. IF animations are needed THEN the system SHALL create skeletal animations for running, jumping, and sliding
5. WHEN assets are complete THEN the system SHALL include proper UV mapping and materials

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish a Blender to GLB export pipeline, so that I can efficiently import 3D assets into the Three.js game engine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting from Blender THEN the system SHALL automatically convert models to GLB format
2. WHEN importing GLB files THEN the system SHALL load them into Three.js with proper materials and textures
3. WHEN textures are exported THEN the system SHALL implement KTX2/Basis texture compression for performance
4. IF multiple models share textures THEN the system SHALL create texture atlases to reduce draw calls
5. WHEN assets are loaded THEN the system SHALL implement LOD (Level of Detail) system with multiple mesh resolutions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Ammo.js or Cannon.js physics engine, so that I can replace simple collision detection with realistic physics simulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the game THEN the system SHALL load and configure either Ammo.js or Cannon.js physics engine
2. WHEN the character moves THEN the system SHALL apply momentum-based movement with proper acceleration and deceleration
3. WHEN collisions occur THEN the system SHALL use physics engine collision detection with collision response forces
4. IF the character jumps THEN the system SHALL implement realistic jump physics with gravity simulation
5. WHEN the character dies THEN the system SHALL activate ragdoll physics for death animation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement an animation state machine, so that character animations transition smoothly between different states (running, jumping, sliding, dying).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the character is running THEN the system SHALL play looping run animation
2. WHEN the character jumps THEN the system SHALL transition from run to jump animation and back to run on landing
3. WHEN the character slides THEN the system SHALL transition to slide animation and return to run when complete
4. IF the character dies THEN the system SHALL transition to death animation with ragdoll physics activation
5. WHEN animations transition THEN the system SHALL blend between states smoothly without jarring cuts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want responsive and predictable physics controls, so that I can develop skill and timing in the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press jump THEN the character SHALL respond immediately with consistent jump height using physics engine gravity
2. WHEN the character lands THEN the physics engine SHALL provide accurate ground detection and landing forces
3. WHEN sliding under obstacles THEN the physics SHALL allow precise collision detection and positioning
4. IF I change direction THEN the character SHALL respond with momentum-based turning using physics forces
5. WHEN collisions happen THEN the physics engine SHALL provide realistic collision response forces and visual feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized performance with 3D assets and physics, so that the game maintains smooth 60 FPS gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering 3D models THEN the system SHALL use LOD system to reduce polygon count at distance
2. WHEN loading textures THEN the system SHALL implement KTX2/Basis compression to reduce memory usage
3. WHEN running physics simulation THEN the system SHALL optimize collision shapes for performance
4. IF frame rate drops THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust LOD levels and physics accuracy
5. WHEN multiple assets are visible THEN the system SHALL use texture atlasing and instancing to reduce draw calls
