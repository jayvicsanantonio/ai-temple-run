## Performance Optimizations

### LOD (Level of Detail) System

- **Distance-based Quality**: Automatically adjusts asset quality based on distance from player
- **Three LOD Levels**: High (0-30m), Medium (30-70m), Low (70-120m)
- **Automatic Culling**: Assets beyond 120m are hidden to improve performance
- **Memory Management**: Efficient instance tracking and cleanup

### Asset Optimization

- **Texture Compression**: Optimized texture loading and compression
- **Material Merging**: Automatic merging of identical materials
- **Instance Management**: Efficient mesh instancing for repeated assets
- **Memory Pooling**: Object pooling for obstacles, coins, and decorations

### Loading Performance

- **Asynchronous Loading**: Non-blocking asset loading with progress tracking
- **Fallback System**: Immediate procedural fallbacks while GLB assets load
- **Preloading**: Strategic asset preloading for smooth gameplay
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing or failed asset loads

## Visual Enhancements

### PBR Materials

- **Realistic Lighting**: Physically Based Rendering for authentic material appearance
- **Texture Mapping**: Proper diffuse, normal, roughness, and AO texture application
- **Material Variety**: Stone, metal, and organic materials for visual diversity
- **Weathering Effects**: Aged and weathered materials for temple atmosphere

### Environmental Atmosphere

- **Temple Entrance**: Impressive entrance gate welcomes players
- **Varied Decorations**: Crystal formations, fountains, vines, and carved symbols
- **Architectural Details**: Ornate pillars, walls, and bridge structures
- **Natural Integration**: Moss, vines, and weathering effects blend architecture with nature

## Technical Implementation

### Asset Loading Pipeline

1. **GLB Model Loading**: Primary loading of temple assets
2. **Texture Loading**: PolyHaven PBR texture sets
3. **Material Creation**: PBR material setup with loaded textures
4. **Instance Creation**: LOD-enabled instance creation
5. **Fallback Handling**: Procedural geometry when GLB unavailable

### Integration Points

- **Game Initialization**: AssetManager loads all assets during game startup
- **World Generation**: WorldManager uses temple assets for procedural world creation
- **Obstacle Spawning**: ObstacleManager creates temple-themed obstacles
- **Coin Collection**: CoinManager uses temple coin collectibles
