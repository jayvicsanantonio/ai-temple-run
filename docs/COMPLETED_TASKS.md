---

## Task 2: Scene Initialization âœ…

### Implementation Details
```javascript
// MainScene class structure
class MainScene {
  - Engine initialization with WebGL2 support
  - Scene creation with fog effects
  - Camera setup (UniversalCamera)
  - Dual lighting system (Hemispheric + Directional)
  - Shadow mapping configuration
  - Skybox implementation
}
```

### Technical Approach
- **Babylon.js Engine**: Configured with anti-aliasing and stencil buffer for better visuals
- **Camera Type**: UniversalCamera positioned behind and above the player for optimal viewing angle
- **Lighting Strategy**: 
  - Hemispheric light for ambient illumination
  - Directional light for shadows and depth

- Shadow generator with blur for soft shadows
- Procedural skybox with gradient effect
- Ground plane (hidden, replaced by tiles)

---

## Task 3: Player Controller âœ…

### Implementation Details
```javascript
class PlayerController {
  // Movement System
  - Lane-based movement (3 lanes: -2, 0, 2 units)
  - Smooth lane transitions using lerp
  - Forward auto-run with adjustable speed
  
  // Jump Mechanics
  - Parabolic jump curve using sine function
  - Jump height: 2.5 units
  - Jump duration: 0.8 seconds
  
  // Slide Mechanics  
  - Player height reduction during slide
  - Visual scaling for feedback
  - Slide duration: 0.8 seconds
}
```

### Technical Approach
- **Lane System**: Discrete positions prevent floating-point errors and simplify collision detection
- **Jump Physics**: `y = baseY + jumpHeight * sin(progress * PI)` creates natural arc
- **Slide Implementation**: Reduces both position.y and scale.y for visual feedback

### Why This Approach?
- **Lane-Based**: Simplifies collision detection and matches original Temple Run mechanics
- **Sine Curve Jump**: More natural than linear interpolation, feels responsive
- **Visual Feedback**: Scaling during actions provides immediate player feedback
- **State Management**: Boolean flags prevent conflicting actions (can't jump while sliding)

### Animation States
- `idle` - Standing still
- `run` - Default running state
- `jump` - Aerial state
- `slide` - Ducking under obstacles
- `death` - Game over animation

  // Procedural Generation
  - Dynamic obstacle placement
  - Coin group spawning
  - Decorative elements (pillars, walls)
  
  // Difficulty Scaling
  - Base difficulty: 1.0
  - Increase rate: 0.01 per second
  - Max difficulty: 3.0
}
```

### Technical Approach
- **Object Pooling**: Pre-creates 10 tiles, expands as needed
- **Spawn Logic**: Checks player position, spawns tiles ahead, recycles behind
- **Difficulty Algorithm**: Linear increase affects spawn rates and obstacle density

### Why This Approach?
- **Performance**: Object pooling prevents garbage collection spikes
- **Infinite World**: Procedural generation ensures unique experiences
- **Memory Efficient**: Recycling tiles keeps memory usage constant
