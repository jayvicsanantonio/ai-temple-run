# Temple Run Asset Audit - September 15, 2025

## Executive Summary

This audit evaluates all existing 3D assets and textures in the Temple Run web game for visual quality, consistency, and optimization. Assets are classified as **Reuse-As-Is**, **Modify**, or **Rebuild** based on their alignment with the target "stylized realism" art direction.

### Textures (`public/assets/textures/`)

#### Stone Textures (PolyHaven)
- ✅ All loaded correctly (castle_wall_slates, broken_wall, dry_riverbed_rock, cliff_side, brick_wall)
- **Classification: Reuse-As-Is** - High quality PBR textures

#### Metal Textures (PolyHaven)
- ✅ All loaded correctly (metal_plate, green_metal_rust, blue_metal_plate)
- **Classification: Reuse-As-Is** - Good variety and quality

#### Organic Textures (PolyHaven)
- ✅ All loaded correctly (bark_brown, brown_mud, fine_grained_wood)
- **Classification: Reuse-As-Is** - Appropriate for environment

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Path System Inconsistency**
- Current path segments don't tile seamlessly
- Width varies between 5.8m and 6.2m (should be exactly 6m for 3 lanes)
- No proper edge definition (missing low walls)
- Pivot points inconsistent

### 2. **Temple Entrance Lacks Impact**
- Current entrance gate is underwhelming
- Missing proper transition from temple to jungle path
- No atmospheric lighting elements

### 3. **Visual Cohesion Problems**
- Mix of art styles (some realistic, some cartoonish)
- Inconsistent weathering/aging across assets
- Color palette varies wildly

### 4. **Performance Issues**
- `temple_complex_main.glb` has 15k triangles (3x budget)
- Several models lack LODs
- No texture atlasing implemented

### 5. **Missing Critical Assets**
- No proper player character (using Pikachu placeholder)
- Missing environmental fog planes
- No particle effect meshes
- Missing modular wall variants

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Rebuild Core Path System
- Create modular 6m x 20m path segments with consistent 2m-wide lanes
- Add low stone walls (0.5m wide x 0.8m tall) with damage variants
- Ensure perfect grid snapping at 1m intervals

### Priority 2: Temple Entrance Overhaul
- Design imposing entrance with collapsed archway
- Add guardian statue bases (heads/arms separate for variation)
- Include transition piece to path system

### Priority 3: Character Replacement
- Design proper temple runner character
- Stylized but athletic build
- Include all required animations

### Priority 4: Environmental Cohesion
- Apply consistent weathering pass to all stone assets
- Add moss vertex painting to appropriate surfaces
- Unify color palette to warm stones and lush greens

### Priority 5: Optimization
- Reduce temple_complex to under 5k triangles
- Generate LOD1 and LOD2 for all hero assets
- Implement texture atlasing for repeated materials

## Asset Classification Summary

- **Reuse-As-Is:** 11 assets (32%)
- **Modify:** 13 assets (38%)
- **Rebuild:** 10 assets (30%)

## Technical Specifications

### Target Metrics
- **Path segments:** ≤3k triangles
- **Decorations:** ≤2k triangles
- **Hero pieces:** ≤5k triangles
- **Texture resolution:** 2048x2048 max
- **Draw calls:** ≤50 per frame target

### Export Settings
- Format: GLB with Draco compression
- Scale: 1 Blender unit = 1 meter
- Up axis: +Y
- Forward axis: -Z
- Origin: Center bottom for props, center for tiles

## Next Steps

1. Set up standardized Blender template with grid and materials
2. Begin with path system rebuild (highest impact)
3. Create art direction reference sheet
4. Establish naming convention for v2 assets
5. Implement version control for .blend source files

## Conclusion

While the current assets provide a functional base, approximately 68% require modification or complete rebuilding to achieve the cohesive "ancient jungle temple" aesthetic. The path system and temple entrance are critical priorities that will have the most immediate visual impact on the game experience.
